## Description
*A room! A trunk! A tube! A bed! A radiator! A light! A landscape! A darkness! A separation! A floating in air! A doubling! An intersection! And more! And more!*

_v r 1_ was made in [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) (using [First Person Drifter](http://torahhorse.com/first-person-drifter-controller-for-unity3d) by [Ben Esposito](http://torahhorse.com/) with a couple of small edits) and [SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com/). Sound effects were made in [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/) and [bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/). _v r 1_ is based on the work of [Gregor Schneider](http://www.gregor-schneider.de/), specifically the room &#8220;u r 1&#8221; in his &#8220;Totes Haus u r&#8221;.
